Some tables have many columns.
Inserting new data would require huge tables on the Wiki page.
But for many tests only some columns are essential.
The same is true for stored procedures with many parameters. A single test should focus on one or two parameters.
To keep the tests focused defaults can be defined for input columns.

!|Define Properties|myDefaults|
|key                    |value     |
|City                   |Berlin    |

 
!|Define Properties|SelectByCityAndName                                           |
|key                    |value                                                         |
|.include               |TestDatabase                                                  |
|cmd                    |select * from TestData where Name ='%Name%' and City ='%City%'|
|#                      |Add above defined defaults to the command definition          |
|InputDefaults          |myDefaults                                                    |
