Some jdbc driver support multiple commands separated with ; in a single execution.
It would be nice to be able to do a combination of select and update statements 

*select - to see the current status
*update - to modify data
*select - to validate the new status

!*> To avoid side effects we execute the test in a transaction
!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|begin transaction             |

*!

!|Define Properties|SelectChain        |
|key               |value              |
|.include          |TransactionDatabase|
|CMD                                   |!- select City as OldCity from TestData where ID ='%ID%';
update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where ID ='%ID%';
select City as FinalCity from TestData where ID ='%ID%'
-!|
|debug||

!|  SQLCommand|SelectChain                       |
|ID           |OldCity?|NewCITY|FinalCity?|Count?|
|6            |London  |+Prag+ |+Prag+    |1     |


!3 Verify all updates
!|SQLCommand|SelectChain|select * from TestData|Query  SUBQUERY  |
|ID<        |Name       |Phone                 |City  |Profession|
|6          |James      |5432                  |+Prag+|Butler    |


!*> Rollback the change to not impact future tests

!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|rollback                      |
|close Connection                      |

!4 Check that the rollback worked
!|SQLCommand|StartupDatabase|select * from TestData|Query                |
|ID         |Name           |Phone                 |City      |Profession|
