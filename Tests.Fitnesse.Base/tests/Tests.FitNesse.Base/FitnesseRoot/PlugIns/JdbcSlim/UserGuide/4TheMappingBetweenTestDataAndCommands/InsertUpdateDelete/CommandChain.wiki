Some jdbc driver support multiple commands separated with ; in a single execution.

!*> To avoid side effects we execute the test in a transaction
!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|begin transaction             |

*!

!3 Two updates in one command

!|Define Properties|CommandChain       |
|key               |value              |
|.include          |TransactionDatabase|

There are 3 matching names and one matching ID. Count should be 3, 1 but H2 reports only the first update 3
!|  SQLCommand|CommandChain|update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where NAME like'%Name%';update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where ID ='%ID%'|
|ID           |Name        |NewCITY                                |Count?                              |Count2?                              |
|3            |B%          |*Madrid*                               |3                                   |1                                    |


Changing the order of the commands we get 1  expected is 1, 3
!|  SQLCommand|CommandChain|update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where ID ='%ID%';update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where NAME like'%Name%'|
|ID           |Name        |NewCITY                                 |Count?                              |Count2?                             |
|4            |B%          |**Sydney**                              |1                                   |3                                   |


!3 Verify all updates
!|SQLCommand|CommandChain|select * from TestData|Query                |
|ID         |Name        |Phone                 |City      |Profession|
|1          |Bill        |12345                 |**Sydney**|Doctor    |
|2          |Ben         |6789                  |**Sydney**|Artist    |
|3          |Tom         |4567890               |*Madrid*  |Milkman   |
|4          |Till        |332211                |**Sydney**|Senator   |
|5          |Sarah       |999999                |Paris     |Hero      |
|6          |James       |5432                  |London    |Butler    |
|7          |Bert        |432                   |**Sydney**|President |
|8          |Kim         |1                     |New York  |Banker    |


!*> Rollback the change to not impact future tests

!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|rollback                      |
|close Connection                      |

!4 Check that the rollback worked
!|SQLCommand|StartupDatabase|select * from TestData|Query                |
|ID         |Name           |Phone                 |City      |Profession|
|1          |Bill           |12345                 |Berlin    |Doctor    |
|2          |Ben            |6789                  |Denver    |Artist    |
|3          |Tom            |4567890               |Seoul     |Milkman   |
|4          |Till           |332211                |Berlin    |Senator   |
|5          |Sarah          |999999                |Paris     |Hero      |
|6          |James          |5432                  |London    |Butler    |
|7          |Bert           |432                   |Washington|President |
|8          |Kim            |1                     |New York  |Banker    |
