To test that code is working it is not enough to check that the code changed the expected data.
It must also be tested that no other data got changed.

JdbcSlim supports this in the following way.

Going back to our initial example where Ben and Sarah moved location.
Additional we want to check that no other user got moved.

!3 Define the query
!|Define Properties|SideEffectCheck                                                                           |
|key               |value                                                                                     |
|.include          |TestDatabase                                                                              |
|cmd               |select * from TestData where Name not in ('Ben', 'Sarah')                                 |
|#                 |The 'query' flag below tells SQL Command that this statement will return more than one row|
|query             |true                                                                                      |

!3 Store the data of the other people before the test

!|Script   |SQLCommand|SideEffectCheck|
|open connection                      |
|execute                              |
|$RSBefore=|resultSheet               |
|close connection                     |


!3 Run the test

!include -c .PlugIns.JdbcSlim.UserGuide.1ASimpleExample 
#


!3 Compare the data of the other people after the test.

!|Script  |SQLCommand  |SideEffectCheck|
|open connection                       |
|execute                               |
|$RSAfter=|resultSheet                 |
|$RSDiff= |compareSheet|$RSBefore      |
|close connection                      |

!|Table:SheetEcho|$RSDiff|
