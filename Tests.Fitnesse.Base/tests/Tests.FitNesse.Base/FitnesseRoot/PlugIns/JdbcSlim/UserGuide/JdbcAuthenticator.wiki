As Jdbc Slim is used for database testing and most databases have user management 
capacities it is straight forward to use the database to authenticate !-FitNesse-! users.  

To do this follow these steps:

1. Add the jdbc slim jar and the jdbc driver jar to the class path of !-FitNesse-!.
2. In the [[plugins.properties][.FitNesse.UserGuide.AdministeringFitNesse.ConfigurationFile]] files add the following line
!note Authenticator =six42.fitnesse.jdbcslim.JdbcAuthenticator
3. Add a file !-JdbcAuthenticator.properties-! in the same folder as the plugins.properties
4. The file must contain two lines which define the database driver and the database connection string
'''No username or password must be specified!'''
See example below 
!note JDBCDRIVER=org.h2.Driver
!note DBURL=jdbc:h2:mem:h2db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

!3 Important: You should only use this Authenticator when you use SSL connections!
Otherwise your database password is transfered in plain text via the network.
