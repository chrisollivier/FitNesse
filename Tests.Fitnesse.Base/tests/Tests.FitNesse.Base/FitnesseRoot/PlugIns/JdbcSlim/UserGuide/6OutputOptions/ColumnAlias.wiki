If your query defines an alias for a column name like below "firstname" then you must use this name in the header.
 

!| SQLCommand|TestDatabase|select ID, Name as firstname from TestData|SORT SUBQUERY|
|ID?>        |firstname?                                                           |
|5           |Sarah                                                                |
|3           |Tom                                                                  |


If you must use the table column name then add the flag '''dbUseColumnName'''
 

!| SQLCommand|TestDatabase|select ID, Name as firstname from TestData|SORT SUBQUERY dbUseColumnName|
|ID?>        |Name?                                                                                |
|5           |Sarah                                                                                |
|3           |Tom                                                                                  |
