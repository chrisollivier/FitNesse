If the query returns many rows but you just want to check some of them and want to ignore the others use the SUBQUERY flag.

!| SQLCommand|TestDatabase|select ID, Name from TestData|SORT SUBQUERY|
|ID?>        |NAME?                                                   |
|5           |Sarah                                                   |
|3           |Tom                                                     |
