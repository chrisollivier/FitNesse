!3  WARNING: Any smart user of FitNesse can decryt the encrypted passwords!
The current implementation avoids that passwords are stored in clear text in files.
If you need more security implement a different store for your passwords.
You can configure a different decrypting mechanism by creating a class implementing `six42.fitnesse.jdbcslim.propertydecode.PropertyDecoder` and setting ".propertyDecoder" to contain its name.

!4 CREDIT: The Encryption implementation is taken from the [[dbfit][http://github.com/dbfit/dbfit]] library.
  
To encrypt a password run:

!note java -cp "commons-codec-1.10.jar;dbfit-3.2.0.jar" dbfit.util.crypto.CryptoApp **SECRET** -keyStoreLocation ${TestDbPath}

Replace **SECRET** with your password
If no keyfile exists it will create a new one named .dbfit.jks
The keyfile must always be named: .dbfit.jks


Define the location of your key file with ".keyStoreLocation" 
it is possible to use multiple key files in different locations.



!|Define Properties|SecretDefinition             |
|key               |value                        |
|user              |James                        |
|.keyStoreLocation |${TestDbPath}                |
|password          |ENC(dP8utYfMtmrWZCylvGsOGw==)|
|cmd               |Save the world!              |

Check that all the content is now available
and the password is not shown in clear text
