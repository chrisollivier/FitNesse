By default the jdbc slim UserGuide is tested against the H2 database driver.
But testing the same tests with other drivers is very simple.

!3 Steps to test the jdbcSlim framework with other drivers:

* Add a child page to this page which is a symbolic link to the UserGuide
* To the child page at a >SuiteSetUp and a >ScenarioLibrary page
  On both pages the path to the driver, the driver class and the dburl must be configured

See samples below:   
!contents -R2 -g -p -f -h
